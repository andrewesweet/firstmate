# Herdr lifecycle declaration - NOT ENABLED
**HARD SAFETY GATE:** this scaffold cannot inspect the task text filled in above.
If the task will start, stop, delete, restart, profile, or otherwise drive Herdr lifecycle behavior, stop and regenerate the brief with `--herdr-lab` before dispatch.
Do not add Herdr lifecycle commands to this unguarded brief by hand.

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of disposable-project, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.

**Verify isolation before anything else.** Run `pwd -P` and `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; both must resolve to the disposable task worktree you were launched in, such as a treehouse pool path or an Orca-managed worktree, not the primary checkout firstmate operates from.
The path check is authoritative: `git rev-parse --git-dir` and `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` can help inspect the repo, but they do not prove you are outside the primary checkout.
If the top-level path is the primary checkout or not the worktree you were launched in, STOP - do not branch or commit here - append `blocked [at=<epoch>]: launched in primary checkout, not an isolated worktree` to the status file and stop.

1. First action: create your branch: `git checkout -b fm/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit --`

# Rules
1. Never push with git and never create a change except through the one `gerrit-axi publish --squash` your Definition of done names. Never run `gerrit-axi submit`, never vote or review a change by any path, including `gerrit review` or a label option on a push, and never abandon one: a human reviewer approves and submits it on the server.
2. Keep project edits inside this worktree; keep proof and scratch output outside it, under `~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/data/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit/` or a temporary directory.
   Outside the worktree, write only that task material and the status and steering-inbox records authorized below.
   Leave the worktree clean before reporting done.
3. Use gh-axi for GitHub operations and chrome-devtools-axi for browser operations.
4. Report status by appending one line:
   `echo "{state} [at=<epoch>]: {one short line}" >> '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/state/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit.status' && { [ ! -e '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/config/fleet-ledger' ] || '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/bin/fm-fleet-ledger.sh' appended '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/config' '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/state/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit.status' >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; }`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, paused, done, failed.
   Substitute `<epoch>` with the current Unix time in seconds - run `date +%s` and write the number it printed; a stamp that is not plain digits records no time at all.
   Each append wakes firstmate, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on (setup done, bug reproduced, fix implemented, validation passed) and the
   needs-decision/blocked/paused/done/failed states. No step-by-step FYI progress lines;
   firstmate reads your pane for that.
   Whenever you mention a PR anywhere - a status line, your terminal, a summary - write its full
   https:// URL exactly as the forge printed it, never a bare number such as "PR 108"; firstmate
   copies that URL from your line rather than assembling one.
   A mid-task `working:` line (including setup complete) is nonterminal: do not end the
   turn after it; continue the same stage until a defined `done:` gate under Definition of done.
   Use `paused: {why}` - distinct from `blocked:` - when deliberately waiting for work or an external condition expected to clear on its own, including your own validation round.
   Before ending your turn with your own background shell or monitor still running, or before waiting on your own pipeline run or a long foreground command, append `paused [at=<epoch>]: {job and completion condition}` to the status file.
   Name what you are waiting for and what will let you resume; do not repeat the declaration on every poll.
   Do not declare active implementation or reasoning as a wait.
   Firstmate may still raise one first-sight alert; the declared wait then uses the existing long recheck cadence instead of repeated possible-wedge alarms.
   When you know when the wait clears, include `until <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ>` (UTC) for a recheck at that time; for your own background job or command with a timeout, that time is its start plus its timeout, rounded up to the minute.
   Follow the resolution rule below when the wait clears, then resume the task.
   Use `blocked:` when you are stuck and need help.

5. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {why}` and stop; firstmate will help.
6. If a decision belongs above the implementation worker (product choices, destructive actions),
   append `needs-decision [at=<epoch>]: {summary of options}` and stop. Firstmate will reply with the decision.

   A decision or blocker you opened stays open until a `resolved` line carrying its exact key lands; a later `done:` or `working:` line never closes it, even when the answer is what started that work.
   Firstmate's reply normally writes that closing line at answer time; when a blocker or wait clears WITHOUT a firstmate reply, append `resolved [at=<epoch>]: {how it cleared}` yourself (same `[key=<slug>]` if you opened it with one) as you resume.
7. Never administer infrastructure that every lane shares. Two things are shared:
   - The `no-mistakes` daemon - one instance serving every lane/home, so stopping, restarting, or
     updating it kills other lanes' in-flight pipeline runs; only firstmate manages the daemon.
     Before you append `blocked:` about the pipeline, run `no-mistakes daemon status` and
     `no-mistakes axi status`. If the daemon socket refuses connections or is missing, append
     `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {the daemon error}` and stop even when the local run record still says running or
     fixing, because that record can be stale after the daemon exits. A run record failed with a
     daemon error is also a real block.
     Only after ruling out socket refusal, if the run is still running or fixing, reattach and keep
     going. A drive-call error, timeout, slow read, or generic unreachability is NOT a daemon error:
     the daemon accepts `respond` immediately and runs the round in the background, so a killed or
     timed-out call was only waiting for a read while the run kept working.
   - The worktree pool your own worktree came from, and the repository every lane's worktree
     shares. Never create, remove, return, prune, move, or reassign a worktree or pool slot, and
     never write into a sibling slot's directory. Rule 2 does not cover this: removing a worktree
     is administration rather than an edit outside your directory, and it lands on lanes that are
     running right now. The act is the rule and commands are only examples of it - `treehouse`
     get/return/remove/prune, the equivalent operations on any other worktree provider or runtime
     backend, and `git worktree add|remove|move|prune`. A slot that looks unused is not evidence
     that it is free, and returning your own worktree is firstmate's job at cleanup, not yours.
   If you genuinely need a second checkout, another slot, or the daemon touched, append
   `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {what you need}` and stop; firstmate arranges it.

# Waiting
Every turn you take resends your whole context, so a wait must cost no turns.
After you append `needs-decision:` or `blocked:`, end your turn at once: do not check the inbox, the status file, or anything else, because the answer arrives as a terminal message that starts your next turn.
Wait on anything external - a pipeline gate, PR checks, a heavy-test slot - with ONE blocking shell command that returns when the state changes: `no-mistakes axi run` or `respond` with `--wait`, `gh pr checks <pr> --watch`, or `until <condition>; do sleep 30; done` for anything else.
Never spend turns on `sleep` followed by a status check, and never background a command in order to poll it.
In Claude Code that `until` loop in a single Bash call is the sanctioned foreground wait: when the harness refuses a sleep-then-check command and points you at backgrounding instead, reissue the wait as the loop rather than accepting the background.
Bound that command by what your harness lets one command run: in Pi pass the bash tool a `timeout` of at most 2700 seconds, because Pi sets none by default; in Claude Code pass the Bash tool its maximum `timeout` of 600000 ms, because its default is 2 minutes; in Codex keep waiting on a still-running command with empty `write_stdin` polls of up to 300000 ms; elsewhere pass your shell tool its largest timeout and assume at most 10 minutes.
Give any `--wait` a duration a little under that bound.
When the bound passes with nothing changed, run the same blocking command again, with no status check in between.
The one exception is `respond`: it sent its answer before it began waiting, so reattach with `no-mistakes axi run --wait` instead, and never send the same `respond` again, because it would answer whichever gate parks next without you reading it.
A wait your shell can watch this way needs no `paused:` line, except your own pipeline run, a long foreground command, or your own validation round, which you declare once just before its blocking hold: append `paused:` once just before its first blocking command, then stay in the command, and never append it again as you reissue that command.

# Firstmate instruction inbox
Firstmate steers you through durable message files in '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/state/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit.inbox'.
When a terminal message says an instruction is waiting there - and at any natural checkpoint when you are unsure - list '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/state/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit.inbox'/*.msg, read and act on each message in numeric order, then acknowledge each handled message by moving it: `mv '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/state/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit.inbox'/NNN.msg '~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/.sibling-sweep-live-cb964jg8/home/state/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit.inbox'/handled/`.
The move IS the acknowledgement: without it firstmate rings again and eventually treats you as stuck. An empty or absent inbox needs no action.
Do not poll or list the inbox while waiting; a waiting instruction rings.

# Project memory
A project's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` is loaded into every agent session in that project, so edit it only to correct information that is factually wrong - including information your own change made wrong - and never to add knowledge because it is missing.
A correction edits only the wrong text: do not run `~/.no-mistakes/worktrees/feb37d45d9da/01M57NE6801MN1TQQ2G3XTE3P0/bin/fm-ensure-agents-md.sh`, create either file, or add sections, headings, or pointers alongside it.

# Definition of done
Delivery contract: mode=direct-PR forge=gerrit shape=squash
Ship branch: fm/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit
This task ships **direct-PR** to a Gerrit review server: you publish the change yourself, without the no-mistakes pipeline.
Gerrit has no pull requests, so there is nothing to open; publishing creates the change.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.

Implement by following the discipline at `~/.agents/skills/implement/SKILL.md`, read as a file: those skills are user-invoked, so read them instead of invoking them through a Skill tool.
Test first with the discipline at `~/.agents/skills/tdd/SKILL.md` at the seams this brief agrees.
Before committing, prove a diff you do not fully trust: name the one fact the change is safe because of and prove it by running the real code (a small script calling the real code), citing the run, or mark the diff unproven.
Before committing a behaviour-preserving change, pin current behaviour first with a characterisation test, snapshot, or equivalence harness - structure moves only after the pin, and type checks and lint are not a pin.
Before committing a bug fix, reproduce the bug on the surface where it was reported, verify the fix on that same surface, and commit the failing reproduction before the fix.
Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.
Then self-review by following both axes at `~/.agents/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` - Standards (this repository's documented standards) and Spec (faithful implementation of this brief) - and fix what you find before committing to your `fm/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit` branch.
In that self-review, check each test with the undefined-imports test before committing: if the test would still pass when every imported function returned undefined, rewrite the assertion or delete it.
Commit to `fm/sweep-boundary-direct-PR-gerrit` only: never main, and never push outside this mode's delivery path.

When it is implemented and committed, publish it.
Publish from this copy with `gerrit-axi`, never with `git push`:
1. Run `git fetch origin` so the server's branch tip is in this repository; `gerrit-axi` reads its base off the server and refuses when that tip is not here.
2. Run `gerrit-axi publish --squash --json`, adding `--branch <b>` only when the task names a target branch other than the server's default.
   It is one push to `refs/for/<branch>` that turns every commit since your branch left the server's branch into ONE change carrying the oldest commit's message, so that message is the review description: make it the one you want reviewed.
   It keeps any `Change-Id` a commit already carries and stamps one into the oldest commit when it has none, rewriting your local branch's messages only.
   Never edit, remove, or regenerate a `Change-Id`: a different one creates a different change and orphans the first one's review, while the same one adds a patch set to it.
   Never pass `--stack`: a stack of changes is not published from this fleet until it can be watched by its membership pinned when its watch is armed, and the watch follows exactly one change.
3. Read the record it prints: `ok` must be `true`, and the one row of its `changes` table is your change. Its `url` is the change URL; when `url` is null, write `https://<host>/c/<project>/+/<change>` from your `origin` remote's host and that row's `project` and `change`.
   A failure prints a typed error record instead; fix what it names and publish again, which updates the same change rather than creating another.
Then append `done [at=<epoch>]: PR {change url} published for review` to the status file and stop. You are finished.
That `done:` is accepted only when the change's current patch set on the server carries this copy's HEAD tree, so commit nothing after publishing; if you must change the work, commit it and publish again before reporting done.
A `done:` whose URL is not the canonical `https://<host>/c/<project>/+/<number>` change URL is refused.
There is no pull request, no `gh-axi` call, and no forge CI result to report: a human reviewer approves and submits the change on the server, and firstmate relays that outcome.
Do NOT run /no-mistakes.
